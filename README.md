# Protein Secondary Structure Prediction using Bidirectional LSTM

Authors: Emily Proctor and David Noblett

This project is a PyTorch implementation of a bidirectional LSTM used to predict per-residue secondary structure assignment given primary amino acid sequence. The model predicts either general, 3-class, or specific, 9-class, secondary structure assignment using DSSP (Database of Secondary Structure Assignments) labels.
